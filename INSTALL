Installation instructions
=========================

Prerequisites:
==============

 * GNU make
 * automake1.7 to execute cleanly autogen.sh
 * glib
 * libipq (in iptables-dev on debian) or libnetfilter_queue (optionally libnetfilter_conntrack)
 * libldap for the provided auth server
 * libsasl2 (cyrus)
 * libgnutls
 * libgcrypt
 * libpam-dev for system authentication module
 * IPy python library for nuauth_command program

Compilation:
============

To compile, use the standard ::

  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make
  make install

If it is a first installation, think to copy the configuration file as it ::

  make install-conf

or run ::

  cp ./conf/nuauth.conf /usr/local/etc/nuauth.conf

Else look for changes between your current conf file and the new one.

Next, you will have to run (as root) nufw.
nufw -h will give you a usage message.

You will also have to launch nuauth, the authorisation server.
nuauth -h will give you a usage message.

To use nufw you will have to run a client for each user.
nutcpc and pam_nufw are provided in NuFW archive.

You will find more informations on:
	http://www.nufw.org

SQL Logging:
============

If you use SQL Logging and SSO features, you may wish to increase performance
of SQL queries by putting closed connections in a different SQL table by using or a script
(cron task ?) or a trigger.
