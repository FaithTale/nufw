Kernel
======

It is recommanded to use a recent kernel to benefit of all latest feature.
A kernel superior to 2.6.18 is a good choice.

The patch dump-connection-mark.diff (in patches/) can be applied to the kernel
to increase performances when doing session logging.


Compilation
===========

To compile, use the standard ::

  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make
  make install

If it is a first installation, think to copy the configuration file as it ::

  make install-conf

or run ::

  cp ./conf/nuauth.conf /usr/local/etc/nuauth.conf

Else look for changes between your current conf file and the new one.

Next, you will have to run (as root) nufw.
nufw -h will give you a usage message.

You will also have to launch nuauth, the authorisation server.
nuauth -h will give you a usage message.

To use nufw you will have to run a client for each user.
nutcpc and pam_nufw are provided in NuFW archive.

You will find more informations on: http://www.nufw.org


SQL Logging
===========

If you use SQL Logging and SSO features, you may wish to increase performance
of SQL queries by putting closed connections in a different SQL table by using or a script
(cron task ?) or a trigger.
