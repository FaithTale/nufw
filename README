SSL usage :

NuAuth :
A key for nuauth can be created wth the following command :
openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -days 365 -out nuauth.pem -keyout nuauth.pem
By default nuauth searches the certificate : CONFIGDIR/nuauth.pem

NuTcpc :
nutcpc looks for a key in the file : 
        $HOME/.nufw/key.pem
to create one you can use :
mkdir ~/.nufw/
chmod 700 ~/.nufw/
cd ~/.nufw/
openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -days 365 -out key.pem -keyout key.pem
cd -
