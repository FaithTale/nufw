# Partial TODO List

# gw pckt srv
- use PRIO (set option and decide for packet when as high as needed)


# User auth srv
- create and maintain a list : user->IP to filter user packet ("anti-DOS")
- use id server and authgw
- down ldap timeout to less than packet timeout
- do a ldap bind
- correct bug in auth reponse (foreach seems to crash)
