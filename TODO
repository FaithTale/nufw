# Partial TODO List

- nuauth : cache : configurable max number of cached entries
                   configurable max number of cached entries per protocol?

- nuauth : display or log a clever message if user sets SSL and certificate is
  unavailable. Else it is pretty hard to diagnose.

- nuauth : check for simultaneous login of same user

- nuauth : do not send hello message if multiple instance runs on the same computer

- nuauth : do a check on src address for every user packet to avoid spoofing

# User auth srv
- deal with reload signals

# Modules
- libdb -> load all in cache and close the file straight away

# Modelizing
- Build groups not only for users, but also for applications, OSes

# TLS
password protected certificat support
