# Partial TODO List

- nuauth : display or log a clever message if user sets SSL and certificate is
  unavailable. Else it is pretty hard to diagnose.

# gw pckt srv
- use PRIO (set option and decide for packet when as high as needed)


# User auth srv
- deal with reload signals

#Modules
- libdb -> load all in cache and close the file straight away

URGENT : in at least log_mysql module :
Make the timestamp logs coherent. It is a BIG mess
