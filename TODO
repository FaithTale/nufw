# Partial TODO List

# gw pckt srv
- use PRIO (set option and decide for packet when as high as needed)


# User auth srv
- use id server and authgw
- down ldap timeout to less than packet timeout
- set packet timeout to less than proto timeout
- finish user activity logging
- deal with reload signals

#Modules
- libdb -> load all in cache and close the file straight away
