NuFW testing
============

This implements a testing system for NuFW.

Results of tests on different architectures are available at:
  https://buildbot.inl.fr/

Requirements
------------

 * NuFW 2.0 or 2.2
 * inl_tests (Python module)

To download latest version of inl_tests:

   svn co http://software.inl.fr/svn/mirror/tools/inl_tests

You have to type "make" in inl_tests diectory to compile dynamic library.


Write config.cfg
----------------

First, you need a valid installation of NuFW (version 2.0 or 2.2) with:
 * nufw
 * nuauth
 * nutcpc

You need a valid account to be able to run nutcpc.

You may configure tests: write your own config based on defaults.cfg.

   cp defaults.cfg config.cfg

defaults.cfg is loaded before config.cfg. So you can just change few options
in you config.cfg.


Run tests
---------

To run tests, set PYTHONPATH environment variable:

   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/MY_LOCAL_PATH_TO/inl_tests

Now you can run one test, example:

    ./test_plaintext_auth.py

Or to run all tests together:

    ./test_all.py

The call to "make check" will also triggered the run of test_all.py.
