== NuFW testing ==

This implements a testing system for NuFW.

Before running test, you need to get a separate component, inl_tests:

svn co http://software.inl.fr/svn/mirror/tools/inl_tests

Then, go to the directory and tape "make".

You need to install NuFW and config files before running tests. Once
this is done you can do :

export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/MY_LOCAL_PATH_TO/inl_tests

and run some tests :
./test_plaintext_auth.py

If you have a complete infrastructure with mysql server and/or ldap you can run:
./test_all.py
