By default, the lock file set by nutcpc is at ~/.nufw/nutcpc
.SH "CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION"
.PP
User authentication can be done using a certificate and a private key. Such a method will be used, if nutcpc can find a certificate at ~/.nufw/cert.pem and the corresponding privat key at ~/.nufw/key.pem. The server identity will be checked if a CA certificate is provided in ~/.nufw/cacert.pem .
.SH "SIGNALS"
.TP
\fBHUP \fR
When receiving this signal, nutcpc attempts to immediately
reconnect to the server, if disconnected. The signal is ignored in
other cases.
