How to control Debugging on Nufw - Vincent Deffontaines 2003

This document is a draft, written before any implementation, to fix what is
going to be done.

Two variables are defined to control debugging :
DEBUG_LEVEL and DEBUG_AREAS


DEBUG_LEVEL can be set by the use of "-v" switches; its value is equal to the
number of "v"s added to 2, and can grow up to 10. If more "v"s should be passed on command
line, they would simply be ignored.
DEBUG_LEVEL controls the verbosity of debug messages, the higher it is, the more
details will be contained in debug messages.
The minimum value for this parameter is 2, "1" is for [fatal] errors, "2" is for
critical messages. Those will always be reported.



DEBUG_AREAS defines which components of Nufw should be sent debug messages
about. If you are debugging the authenticating part of nufw at DEBUG_LEVEL 8, you
probably don't really care about debug messages from the ipq interface part.
DEBUG_AREAS must be calculated as the sum of these :
1	
2	
4	
8	
16	
32	
64	


These 2 variables, properly set, should help debugging in details.
