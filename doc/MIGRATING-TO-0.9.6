The SQL table has been altered, both for Mysql and Postgresql.
It now supports two new fields : 'client_os' and 'client_app'. Those fields get
filled with, respectively : 
  the client's claimed Operating system name, version and release
  the client's claimed application name

Consider the script conf/nulog-before-0.9.6.*.dump to add those fields to your
existing config.
