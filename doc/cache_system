Cache is for protocol v2 only
authentication is done once (at the beginning or after inactivity timeout ..) by SSL session
cache access are done through a queue maintained by a dedicated thread
cache thread answers to query via a private queue on which the query thread listen to.
	If return is NULL then query has to be done on db : unavailable data or data need a refresh
	If return is not NULL then this a pointer to our data
If query thread receive NULL, it queries db and send a message to cache thread with the result of his query.
when data are no more used, thread send a message to warn the cache thread
when the cache thread find that a resource has 0 access it look if it needs to be freed.
Periodically main thread sends a message to ask a cleaning of resources.

Thus we have the following messages :
get key
send key data
update all

User : (in fact Alternative at bottom is implemented) 
	public :
		groups list
	private : 
		old data : chained list of pointer (keep trace of used data to to a clean refresh when they are of no use)
		create_timestamp
		refresh_timestamp
		nb_of_uses
		refreshing
	
Acl :
	public : decisions list
	private : 
		old data : chained list of pointer (keep trace of used data to to a clean refresh when they are of no use)
		create_timestamp
		refresh_timestamp
		nb_of_uses
		refreshing
	
generic cache system :
	base element :
		"public" : pointer
		obscure : 
		create_timestamp
		refresh_timestamp
		nb_of_uses
		refreshing
global structure :
	using hash
|
|-key => chained list of element (only first is significant and used in return)
|
| ...

cache thread algorithm :

while (get_queue){
	switch (  message ){
		GET key :
			if (data is refreshing){
				push request to local queue;
			}
			if (data need refresh){
				set refreshing bit;
				return NULL to asking thread;
			}
			if (data is not here){
				create NULL data with key and refreshing set;
				return NULL to asking thread;
			}
			if (data is here){
				increase usage count;
				return data to asking thread;
			}
		PUT key data :
			if (data is refreshing){
				ok proceed;
				remove refreshing tag;
				loop through local queues and answer to concern thread;
			} else {
				What's the fuck !
			}
		FREE key pointer :
			if (pointer is pointer to current data, first element of data){
				decrease usage count;
			}
			if (pointer is one pointer from old data){
				decrease usage count;
				free data if (usage count is 0)
			}

		UPDATE ALL :
			loop trough key, delete data where usage count is NULL and refresh time exceeded (suppress entry from hash)
	}
}

current code modification :

	ask cache before doing request
	wait answer from cache (timeout, setting of an async queue per thread)
	send a PUT message when request is done
	send a FREE message when we free connection

USER cache :
	each user is identified by his SSL fd.
	so we link 
	SSL fd     -> 	userid 
			List of groups
	Modification of user are local :
		A user got a few modification only, if never of its group list
		A reconnect can be done easily if necessary
