.SH NAME
nuauth \- NUFW authentication server
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBnuauth\fR [ \fB-h\fR ] [ \fB-V\fR ] [ \fB-v[v...]\fR ] [ \fB-l \fI(local, for clients) port\fB\fR ] [ \fB-C \fI(local, for clients) address\fB\fR ] [ \fB-L \fI(local, for nufw) address\fB\fR ] [ \fB-p \fI(local, for nufw) port\fB\fR ] [ \fB-t \fItimeout\fB\fR ] [ \fB-D\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This manual page documents the
\fBnuauth\fR command.
.PP
Nuauth is the authentication server of the NUFW package. Whenever a
client sends a packet(1) to start a connection through the gateway, the
client program (nutcpc), installed on the client's station, sends an
authentication packet(2) to nuauth. The gateway's firewall queues the
packet(1) and sends informations about it directly to the nuauth server. 
Nuauth's job is to analyse both packets(1) and (2), and check user owns 
the right to initialize the connection (s)he has tried to. If Nuauth finds 
so, Nuauth sends authorization to Nufw to accept the packet(1) through, 
and the connection gets initialized. If not, the connection is Dropped.
.PP
Nuauth can use a backend LDAP server for user and groups
definitions, as well as Access Lists associated with those groups.
Interface to Users/Groups database can also be performed through PAM/NSS.
An option is also to store the user database in DBM files. It should be
noted that dynamic modifications of the users base can currently 
only be performed if an LDAP database is used.
.PP
Original packaging and informations and help can be found from http://www.nufw.org/
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-h \fR
Issues usage details and exits.
.TP
\fB-V \fR
Issues version and exits.
.TP
\fB-v \fR
Increases verbosity level. Multiple switches are accepted and each
of them increases the verbosity level by one. Default verbosity level is 2, max is 10.
.TP
\fB-l \fIport\fB \fR
Specifies TCP port to listen on for clients.  Default value : 4129
.TP
\fB-L \fIaddress\fB \fR
Address to listen on for NuFW packets. Default : 127.0.0.1
.TP
\fB-C \fIaddress\fB \fR
Address to listen on for clients packets. Default : 0.0.0.0
.TP
\fB-d \fIaddress\fB \fR
Network address of the nufw (gateway) servers. Only NuFW servers
at those addresses will be allowed to talk to nuauth.
.TP
\fB-p \fIport\fB \fR
This option is DEPRECATED and was in use only in v1 of the
protocol, which was proof of concept, non-encrypted.

Specifies UDP port to send data to when addressing the nufw
(gateway) server. Nufw server must be setup to
listen on that port. Default value : 4128
.TP
\fB-t \fIseconds\fB \fR
Specifies timeout to forget packets not identified, and
identification packets matching nothing.  Default value : 15 s.
.TP
\fB-D \fR
Run as a daemon.
.SH "SIGNALS"
.PP
The \fBnuauth\fR daemon is designed to deal with several
signals : USR1, USR2, and POLL.
.TP
\fBUSR1 \fR
Increases verbosity. The daemon then acts as if it had been
launched with one supplementary '-v'.A line is also added to the system
log to mention the signal event.
.TP
\fBUSR2 \fR
Decreases verbosity. The daemon then acts as if it had been
launched with one less '-v'. A line is also added to the system
log to mention the signal event.
.TP
\fBPOLL \fR
Logs an "audit" line, mentioning how many network datagrams
were received and sent since daemon startup.
