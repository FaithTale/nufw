.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This manual page documents the
\fBnutop\fR command.
.PP
Nutop is to be used by administrators willing to view users activity
on a NuFW server, in real time. The display is designed to look a lot like
the well known top command, as far as general layout is concerned.
.PP
The default configuration file (containing SQL connections
parameters) is located at /etc/nufw/nutop.conf. If decided to
customize it to their needs, care should be taken about file permissions
on that file, as it might let any user of the system access to the NuFW
connection tracking database.

Original packaging and informations and help can be found from http://www.nufw.org/
