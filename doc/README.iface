Experimental support of transmission of interface name from kernel to NuFW
is available.

Patches found in the patches directory need to be applied to
be able to use the feature.

You first need to patch kernel with :
    nfnetlink_queue-ifacename.diff

Then you can patch libnetfilter_queue with :
    libnetfilter_queue-ifacename.diff

Compile patched kernel and libnetfilter_queue.


NuFW's configure will autodetect the presence of a modified
version and use the feature if available.
