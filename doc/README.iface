Interface name logging
======================

Support of transmission of interface name from kernel to NuFW
is available.

It can be used by fetching libnfnetlink and libnetfilter_queue from 
Netfilter with version superior to:

 * libnfnetlink-0.0.25
 * libnetfilter_queue-0.0.13

NuFW's configure will autodetect the presence of a modified
version and use the feature if available.
