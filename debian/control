Package: nufw
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, debconf (>= 1.3.22), ssl-cert, openssl
Description: a per-user firewalling daemon that interferes with libipq
 NuFW is an authenticating gateway, which means that connections are
 authenticated before being forwarded through the gateway.  Classical packet
 filtering systems disregard the identity of the user who may be attempting to
 access the network, instead caring only about the originating IP addresses.
 .
 Nufw is the daemon that receives some network packets through the NFQUEUE
 netfilter rule.  Informations about those packets are forwarded to the
 nuauth daemon, which decides if packets should be accepted or denied,
 sends back the information to Nufw that applies decisions.
 .
 To use this package, you must have a recent kernel (>= 2.6.18)

Description: The authentication daemon from the nufw package
 NuFW is an authenticating gateway, which means that connections are
 authenticated before being forwarded through the gateway.  Classical packet
 filtering systems disregard the identity of the user who may be attempting to
 access the network, instead caring only about the originating IP addresses.
 .
 Nuauth lays on a user database, and an ACL system (which can reside in an LDAP
 directory, or XML/DBM solutions, etc.
 Nuauth receives requests from nufw, and auth packets from users' clients,
 and sends decision to the nufw daemon.
