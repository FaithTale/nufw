Description: a per-user firewalling daemon that interfers with libipq
 NuFW is an authenticating gateway, which means that connections are
 authenticated before being forwarded through the gateway.  Classical packet
 filtering systems disregard the identity of the user who may be attempting to
 access the network, instead caring only about the originating IP addresses.
 .
 Nufw is the daemon that receives some network packets through the QUEUE
 netfilter rule.  Informations about those packets are forwarded to the 
 nuauth daemon, which decides if packets should be accepted or denied, 
 sends back the information to Nufw that applies decisions.

 NuFW is an authenticating gateway, which means that connections are
 authenticated before being forwarded through the gateway.  Classical packet

 Nuauth lays on a user database, and an ACL system (which can reside in an LDAP
 directory, or XML/DBM solutions, etc.
 Nuauth receives requests from nufw, and auth packets from users' clients,
 and sends decision to the nufw daemon.
